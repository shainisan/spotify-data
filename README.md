Analyse Your Spotify Data with Python and Spotipy


## Introduction
Spotify has a fantastic API enabling you to connect to its huge music, song features, and trends database. With Spotify's API you can the insights about the music you listen to, use a powerful search engine, get access to Spotify's amazing recommendation system, and integrate Spotify's features into your own apps.

## Prerequisites
First, we'll have to sign up at the official Spotify Developer Portal, head over to the Dashboard and get our ClientID and Client Secret. We'll also have to register a redirect URI to our app at My Dashboard (navigate to your application and then [Edit Settings]). The redirect URI can be any valid URI (it does not need to be accessible) such as http://example.com.

We'll use Spotipy, which is a  lightweight Python library for the Spotify Web API.
